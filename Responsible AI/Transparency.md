# Transparency

- Transparency and intelligibility can help us achieve a really diverse range of goals.
- Things from mitigating unfairness in machine learning systems to helping developers debug their AI systems, to gaining more trust from our users.
- There are two sides to transparency:
    - people who create AI systems should be open about how and why they're using AI, and also open about the limitations of their systems.
    - people should be able to understand the behavior of AI systems, this is what you often hear referred to as interpretability or intelligibility.
