# Inclusiveness

- Empower and engage the communities around the world.
- Make sure that no one is left out.
- Make sure that we are intentionally inclusive and intentionally diverse with the approaches that we take towards AI.
- Make sure that that full spectrum of communities are covered.
- Make sure that experiences like seeing AI, speech-to-text translation out of PowerPoint, and other technological examples that we have that we're building upon including the **Microsoft Accessibility Standards** represent just an example of the extensive toolkits to ensure everyone truly designs for an inclusive AI future.
 - Ensure that these future experiences are truly representative of the under-served minority communities.
 - Make sure that they're involved both in their earliest concepts and future design and planning, but making sure that they're part of our testing that we are also building with side-by-side individuals to make sure that we are not taking an ableist perspective for the population we intend to serve.
