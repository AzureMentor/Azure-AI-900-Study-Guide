# Transparency

Transparency and intelligibility can help us achieve a really diverse range of goals. So things from mitigating unfairness in machine learning systems to helping developers debug their AI systems, to gaining more trust from our users. There are two sides to transparency; in part transparency means that the people who create AI systems should be open about how and why they're using AI, and also open about the limitations of their systems. Transparency also means that people should be able to understand the behavior of AI systems, this is what you often hear referred to as interpretability or intelligibility.
