# Accountability

- Despite all the complexity with these new models and with new technology that can be somewhat unpredictable and somewhat hard to interpret, we are still accountable for how our technology impacts the world.
- Accountability is the structure that we put in place so that we make sure that we consistently are enacting our principles and that we're taking them into account in everything that we do.
- Part of our accountability is to help our customers and partners be accountable.
- Microsoft has a set of principles that guide how to develop and how to sell, and how to advocate for regulation on facial recognition. All three of those pieces are really critical to be accountable.
- While there is a lot of great uses, there are a lot of uses that could interfere with people's civil liberties or pushed aside in a direction that we're really not interested in supporting.
- So in moving from the facial recognition principles to practices and processes that can be followed across the company, Microsoft takes a high level principle, such as the commitment to Fairness, and think about how to have development teams view every stage of the development life-cycle with those principles.
- Microsoft has a set of guidelines that the teams can follow and think about these considerations at every step of the life-cycle.
